<p class="message">
  Hey there! I am Ujjwal. I use this blog to express my thoughts on several different areas of my life. I also use this blog to keep notes on certain important methods for optimizing health, fitness, relationships with family and friends, and finances. 
  
  At present, the main common theme I find in the blog posts is that there is trade-off in everything we do. The reason why I write this blog publically is because I believe this information might be useful to others. 
</p>

Professional Credentials: I received Ph.D. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ in 2018 and 2014, respectively. I currently work at Intel Corporation as SoC Power Management Architect for Xeon processors. My research interests are Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Dynamic Power Management for Multi-processor System-on-a-chip and Flexible Hybrid Electronics.
