I always loved teaching, whether hands-on microcontroller tutorials as an undergraduate student or as a Teaching Assistant in graduate school. In fact, that is why I pursued a Ph.D. so that I can teach in academia. However, I developed different interests and gravitated toward an industry job with more immediate impact. 

However, the teaching bug inside of me never died. I kept finding a setup to easily record and upload lectures online. Recently, I found one of the easiest methods to do this, requiring much less setup time.

* Hardware: iPad (any basic model will do) + Apple pencil 

* App: Notability 

* Video Editing: ScreenPal (may not be the best) 

* Video publishing: Youtube
