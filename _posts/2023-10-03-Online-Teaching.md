I always loved teach, weather it was hands-on microcontroller tutorials as an undergraduate student or as a Teaching Assistant in gradaute school. In fact, that is why I pursued Ph.D. so that I can teach in academia. However, along the way I developed different interests and gravitated towards an industry job, where impact is more immedeate.  

However, the teaching bug inside of me never died. I kept trying to find a setup so that I can easily record and upload lectures online. Recently, I found one of the easiest methods to do this that requires very less setup time.

In my view, Apple's ipad coupled with Apple pencil, is the most user friendly device to record lectures. You don't even need a separate mic, the in-built mic is excellent. I have resisted Apple products for the last 10 years mainly due to lock into expensive eco-system. However, I am blown away by the simplicity of creating these lectures in ipad.
