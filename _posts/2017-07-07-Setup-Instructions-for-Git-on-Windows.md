This is just one of the ways of using Git. There are several other ways that can involve setting up your own server for repositories or using other services, such as Github. A good friend of mine, Ayush Rai helped me explore this procedure. Please note that I was using this procedure in 2015, so the steps below may have changed slightly. Let me know it this does not work.

### Downloads

* [Bit-bucket] (https://bitbucket.org/): Setup an account in bitbucket.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/download/): Install Git in your PC.

* [Smart-Git](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download/): Install Smart-Git client in your PC. The software is free for non-commercial use.

### Setup

* SSH key setup for your computer (You can use Git Bash for this step): [link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2)

* Make sure that the .ssh folder is in your user folder. For example, Users/Ujjwal/

* Add the key to your Bit-bucket account: [link](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/)

* Start Smart-Git and follow screen instructions to setup, you will be asked to provide your Bit-bucket username and password

That is it! You have the setup ready
